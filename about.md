Hello, my name is Jay Molinaro. I am a Junior at The Pennsylvania State University majoring in Security & Risk Analysis with a primary focus on Information & Cyber Security. I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I have been raised there my entire life. I am interested in all things involving the rapidly evolving field of Information Technology and aspire to learn as much as possible about the technology and infrastructure that drives the modern world.
